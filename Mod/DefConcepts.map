Actions:
civic/ethics actions x1 -  50 <<  100 ?? s/3 40 - 7*8 + 16 = 56+16 = 72 || 5*8 + 16 = 56
building actions x3  ---- 150 >>  100 ?? s/3 50
research actions x3 ----- 150 <   200 ?? s/3 120 (moo - 180)
species-mod actions x1 --  50 <<  100 ?? s/3 50
terraforming actions x1 -  50 =    50 ?? s/3 ?? (30)
shipyard actions x2 ----- 100 >>   50 ?? s/3 100 (50w 50aux)
ship actions x3 --------- 150 >>>  50 ?? s/3 ?? (20 combat 100 explore)

Pillars: 
- You head down a path that becomes horiffic, but you are locked on that path, even if people become pissed that you headed down tha path.
- Slow creeping crisis eating systems

WAR HAPPINESS INDUSTRY AUTHORITY INFLUENCE XENO-ROLE ROBOTS SPECIES TERRAFORMING DIVERGENCE ACTION-CONTROL INTERNAL-MIGRATION EXTERNAL_MIGRATION

Ethics:
- Pacifist (less war) - Millitarist (more war)
- Ecologist (more terraforming, more happiness) - Industrialist (more industry, less happiness)

- Religious(more authority, more action control) - Scientist (more science)
